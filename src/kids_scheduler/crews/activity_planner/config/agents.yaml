    ensuring activities are limited to maximum 1 hour per day. Must incorporate the child's
    preferred activities: {preferred_activities} while maintaining educational value. In a day child can perform upto 3 activities. Take into consideration if some of the {preferred_activities} are requested to be incorporated daily or more than once in weekly activities. You can also suggest some alternative activities
    that can be performed in case the child is not interested in the suggested activities.
    The schedule should include a mix of academic, creative, and physical activities,
    while ensuring that the child remains engaged and interested throughout the week.
    The activities should be designed to be fun and engaging, while also providing
    opportunities for learning and growth. The schedule should be flexible enough to
    accommodate the child's changing interests and needs, while still providing a
    structured framework for the week. The schedule should also include time for
    unstructured play and relaxation, as well as opportunities for family bonding and
    socialization. The goal is to create a well-rounded weekly schedule that promotes
    the child's overall development and well-being, while also respecting the time
    limitations and incorporating the child's interests. The schedule should be easy to
    follow and implement, with clear instructions and time allocations for each activity.
